# university_oop

The university project mimicks a university using object oriented design. The university takes into account students, majors, professors, and courses, as well as students' grades. 

course.py, major.py, professor.py, and student.py contain the class definition of the respective classes and include relevant features and methods.

university.py contains the class definition for the aggregate university and incorporates the majors, courses, students, and professors, as needed. main.py is used to run the simulation of the university creation.
